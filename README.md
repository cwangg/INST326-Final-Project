How to run: The program can be run as a script in the terminal. To begin the program, type “python3 test.py”

How to use: After running the script, follow the prompts in the terminal by typing the name of the grocery store, your name, and your budget– hitting enter each time. At this point you can continue adding items to your cart until you checkout or leave the store. Type “add” to add, “checkout” to checkout, and “leave” to leave. When you are adding an item, a list of products that are available in the store are shown in the terminal for your convenience. You will then be asked how much of the item you want– input a number. This list will update the remaining quantity once you specify how much. When you checkout, the program randomly generates a coupon and prints the discount and product. You can use this coupon by typing “yes” and your total-after-discount is calculated and printed. You can type “no” to not use the coupon and go back to shopping– you will get a different coupon next time you checkout. If you leave the store you can “Have a nice day!”
